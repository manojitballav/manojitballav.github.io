                <h1>The State of CTV in 2025: Why Connected TV is Eating Traditional Broadcasting</h1>
                <div class="blog-detail">Posted <span>10 December 2024</span> by Mono</div>

                <div class="blog-content">

                    <p>We've crossed a historic threshold. In 2025, streaming accounts for <strong>44.8% of total TV viewership</strong>, officially surpassing the combined share of broadcast (20.1%) and cable (24.1%). This isn't a trend anymore - it's the new reality of television.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "90% of US households now use internet-connected TV devices at least once per month. CTV is no longer the future - it's the present."
                    </blockquote>

                    <h2>The Numbers Tell the Story</h2>

                    <p>Let's look at the data driving this transformation:</p>

                    <ul class="list-style">
                        <li><strong>117 million households</strong> in the US use CTVs in 2025, projected to reach 121 million by 2027</li>
                        <li>The average US adult watches <strong>more than 2 hours of CTV daily</strong> - expected to grow 25% by 2026</li>
                        <li>US CTV ad spending: <strong>$32.45 billion in 2025</strong>, projected to surpass traditional TV by 2028 at $45.96 billion</li>
                        <li><strong>68% of marketers</strong> now view CTV as a "must-have" in their media mix</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The Ad-Supported Revolution</h2>

                    <p>One of the most significant shifts in 2025 is the rise of ad-supported streaming. By Q1 2025, <strong>ad-supported subscriptions accounted for 57% of new subscriber additions</strong>. The economics are clear: consumers want premium content but are increasingly price-sensitive.</p>

                    <p>US viewing time on FAST (Free Ad-Supported Streaming TV) platforms reached <strong>1.8 billion hours in August</strong>, up 43% year-over-year. This represents a fundamental shift in how content is monetized and consumed.</p>

                    <h2>Programmatic Takes Over</h2>

                    <p>The technical infrastructure of CTV advertising has matured dramatically. In 2025, <strong>over 90% of CTV ad dollars</strong> are transacted through programmatic pipes. This automation is driving efficiency but also raising the bar for targeting and measurement.</p>

                    <p>Key programmatic trends:</p>

                    <ul class="list-style">
                        <li>Voice and remote interactivity becoming standard by 2026</li>
                        <li>Dynamic Creative Optimization (DCO) adoption doubling by 2027</li>
                        <li>Interactive shoppable ads expected to represent 10% of all CTV ads by 2026</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The Platform Wars</h2>

                    <p>The CTV landscape remains highly competitive:</p>

                    <p><strong>Roku</strong> maintains a leading position with 37% market share in North America, followed by Amazon at 17%. But the streaming content wars are equally fierce - Netflix, YouTube, Disney, and Amazon account for most streaming time today.</p>

                    <p>The industry anticipates consolidation. A potential Disney+ and Hulu merger in 2026 could reshape the competitive landscape, potentially giving Disney $3 billion in additional US ad revenues.</p>

                    <h2>The India Opportunity</h2>

                    <p>While the US leads in CTV maturity, India represents perhaps the most exciting growth story:</p>

                    <ul class="list-style">
                        <li>CTV households could reach <strong>60 million by end of 2025</strong> - a 4x increase from 2020</li>
                        <li>The India Smart TV and OTT market: <strong>$22.39 billion in 2025</strong>, projected to reach $51.65 billion by 2030</li>
                        <li>Growth rate of <strong>18.2% CAGR</strong> - among the fastest globally</li>
                        <li>5G rollout creating new opportunities for streaming quality</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The Indian market has unique characteristics: a strong preference for regional content, price sensitivity driving FAST adoption, and a mobile-first audience transitioning to big-screen experiences.</p>

                    <h2>What's Driving the Shift</h2>

                    <p>Several factors are accelerating CTV adoption:</p>

                    <p><strong>Content Quality:</strong> Streaming-first productions now rival theatrical releases. The perception gap between "TV content" and "premium content" has vanished.</p>

                    <p><strong>User Experience:</strong> Smart TV interfaces have matured. Voice control, personalized recommendations, and seamless app switching have made CTV as intuitive as traditional TV.</p>

                    <p><strong>Economic Reality:</strong> Cord-cutting saves money. With ad-supported tiers from Netflix, Disney+, and others, premium content is more accessible than ever.</p>

                    <p><strong>Generational Shift:</strong> Younger audiences have never had cable loyalty. For them, CTV isn't an alternative - it's the default.</p>

                    <h2>Challenges Ahead</h2>

                    <p>The CTV ecosystem isn't without problems:</p>

                    <p><strong>Measurement fragmentation:</strong> Unlike digital advertising, CTV measurement standards are still maturing. The industry is moving beyond clicks and impressions - attention measured through time-in-view, creative resonance, and contextual alignment is becoming the new performance signal.</p>

                    <p><strong>Monetization gap:</strong> CTV remains a highly engaged environment but is under-monetized relative to time spent. In 2026, that gap in spend will likely narrow as outcome measurement improves.</p>

                    <p><strong>Signal loss:</strong> As third-party cookies phase out, CTV advertisers must adapt to new identity and targeting paradigms.</p>

                    <h2>What This Means for Product Leaders</h2>

                    <p>For those of us building CTV products, the implications are clear:</p>

                    <ul class="list-style">
                        <li><strong>Speed matters more than ever.</strong> With users juggling multiple streaming apps, the TV that loads fastest wins engagement.</li>
                        <li><strong>AI integration is table stakes.</strong> From content discovery to voice control, intelligent features are expected, not exceptional.</li>
                        <li><strong>The living room is the new battleground.</strong> Smart TVs are becoming central hubs for entertainment, gaming, fitness, and smart home control.</li>
                        <li><strong>Regional content wins in emerging markets.</strong> Global platforms are learning that localization isn't optional.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <blockquote>
                        "The TV industry hasn't seen disruption of this magnitude since the transition from broadcast to cable. We're witnessing the complete reimagining of television."
                    </blockquote>

                    <h2>Looking Ahead to 2026</h2>

                    <p>Predictions for the next 12 months:</p>

                    <ul class="list-style">
                        <li>Global CTV ad spending will hit <strong>$46.3 billion</strong></li>
                        <li>AI will reduce ad production costs dramatically, enabling more creative experimentation</li>
                        <li>Shoppable TV will move from novelty to meaningful revenue stream</li>
                        <li>Platform consolidation will accelerate</li>
                        <li>India and Southeast Asia will be the primary growth engines</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The connected TV revolution is no longer coming - it's here. The question isn't whether traditional broadcasting will survive, but what role it will play in an increasingly streaming-first world.</p>
